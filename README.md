----------
Theo is a bot that is meant to be added to groups and will respond your dumbass friend with a variety of usefull and original insults, while don't letting them forget that 4th Gen is bad and they should instead turn to the better 3rd Gen.

The name comes from one of Asato Asato's novels 86 - Eighty Six. Theotto Rikka is quite the edgy boy, so we thought that him friendly badmouthing you and your friends is quite on point.

## **Extra**

If you want to improve on it's desing, go ahead, it was written a random afternoon while doing some memes. Still, if you find a bug or think that you could improve it, don't be afraid of contacting me on twitter (@kakoALB) or leaving a issue here.

I want to thank Refia who gave me the idea of this bot after seeing my 10k+ lines of insults processed from twitter.

Also a Spanish demo it's running in @BlondeEdgyBot (or should be, no stable hosting as of writing this README).
